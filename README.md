<h2 style="color: rgb(76, 76, 155);">About the project</h2>
The project was built after I built a website while studying a course in UDEMY. I wanted to build something of my own and combining the knowledge I had learned into a Udemy course.

During the project I learned to use DB more deeply - create models, send data to DB and receive them, connect models with each other and more. I was able to understand in more depth validation. I also discovered how to send letters to new users etc.

I built the project, using a combination of new material I learned, and also added my current knowledge.

In the process of building, it was important to me first to see that my idea was published, only when I made sure everything worked, I progressed to the design part of the site.
